# VAC Module Dumper

VAC Module Dumper is a small utility that captures the antiâ€‘cheat modules downloaded by Steam and writes them to disk. It hooks the internal loading routines of `steamservice.dll` using [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook).

## Building

The original project ships with a Visual Studio solution. You can either open `VacDumper.sln` in Visual Studio 2019+ or build with **CMake**:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

MinHook is included as a subdirectory and no additional dependencies are required.

### Documentation

This repository uses Doxygen-style comments. Run `doxygen` to generate the HTML
documentation inside the `docs` folder.

## Usage

Inject the resulting `VacModuleDumper.dll` into `steam.exe` **with administrator privileges**. Extracted modules are written to `C:\VacDump` by default along with the ICE keys used for decryption.

You can change the output path by editing the variable `g_dumpPath` in `dllmain.cpp`.
